excerpt: 'There is an explosion of camera surveillance in our cities today. As a result, the risks of privacy infringement and erosion are growing, as is the need for ethical solutions to minimise the risks. This research aims to frame the challenges and ethics of using data surveillance technologies in a qualitative social context. A use case is presented which examines the ethical data required to automatically enforce bus lanes using camera surveillance and proposes ways of minimising the risks of privacy infringement and erosion in that scenario. What we seek to illustrate is that there is a challenge in using technologies in positive, socially responsible ways. To do that, we have to better understand the use case and not just the present, but also the downstream risks, and the downstream ethical questions. There is a gap in the literature in this aspect as well as a gap in the actual thinking of researchers in terms of understanding and responding to it. A literature review and detailed risk analysis of automated bus lane enforcement is conducted. Based on this, an ethical design framework is proposed and applied to the use case. Several potential solutions are created and described. The final chosen solution may also be broadly applicable to other use cases. We show how it is possible to provide an ethical AI solution for detecting infringements that incorporates privacy-by-design principles, while being fair to potential transgressors. By introducing positive, pragmatic and adaptable methods to support and uphold privacy, we support access to innovation that can help us mitigate current emerging risks.'

"Creating ethics guidelines for artificial intelligence and big data analytics customers: The case of the consumer European insurance market"
---
collection: publications

permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1

excerpt: 'The European Union (EU) has a strong reputation and track record for the development of guidelines for the ethical use of artificial intelligence (AI) generally. In this paper, we discuss the development of an AI and ethical framework by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), for the European insurance market. EIOPA's earlier report on big data analytics (EIOPA, 2019) provided a foundation to analyze the complex range of issues associated with AI being deployed in insurance, such as behavioral insurance, parametric products, novel pricing and risk assessment algorithms, e-service, and claims management. The paper presents an overview of AI in insurance applications throughout the insurance value chain. A general discussion of ethics, AI, and insurance is provided, and a new hierarchical model is presented that describes insurance as a complex system that can be analyzed by taking a layered, multi-level approach that maps ethical issues directly to specific level(s).'

Big data analytics and increasingly sophisticated forms of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning applications are now part of the catalog of tools and methods that inform the insurance industry's back-end and front-end operations. Insurance products and services are important to support economic and societal development. From commercial property insurance, vehicle insurance, and personal health insurance, availability and access to affordable insurance products are key to society and citizens. That said, insurance products and services can only be accessible if a sustainable balance is achieved between the pricing of policies, operational costs, and claims. AI and machine learning have already proved valuable to the insurance industry in sustaining this balance. However, with the increased use of AI and machine learning, new risks and ethical questions are introduced to the insurance pipeline. Accordingly, there is a need to investigate the ethical contexts and questions of data use in insurance innovation and highlight the emerging tensions and concerns where possible. The paper combines the expertise of insurance experts and an AI ethics expert to assess and better understand some of the ethical ground relating to the tensions concerning how the insurance industry uses big data analytics, AI, and machine learning methods to sustain its commercial operations.

"Surveillance and privacy–Beyond the panopticon. An exploration of 720-degree observation in level 3 and 4 vehicle automation"

excerpt: 'On the path to high-level vehicle automation, the degree of surveillance both inside and outside the car increases significantly. Consequently, ethical considerations are becoming central to questions around surveillance regimes and data privacy implicit in level 3 and 4 vehicle automation. In this paper, we focus on outputs from the EU Horizon 2020 project Vision Inspired Driver Assistance Systems (VI-DAS). In particular, we assess the VI-DAS 720-degree observation technology, critical to ensuring a safe Human Machine Interaction (HMI), from multiple theoretical perspectives to contribute to a better understanding of the phenomena of privacy. As a synonym for surveillance, we started our evaluation with Bentham's ideation of the panopticon. From there, it is a relatively short step to radical Foucauldian critiques that offered more dystopian technologies of power. However, both theorems demonstrate a limited understanding of the issue of data privacy in the context of safe transportation along the evolution of highly automated vehicles. Thus, to allow the debate to move beyond more binary discussions on privacy versus control/power and to a certain degree escape the shadow of the panopticon, we applied the Nissenbaum four theses framework of Contextual Integrity (CI). Her decision heuristic allowed us to introduce structure and a degree of precision in our thinking on the matter of privacy that represents a step forward to phenomena of privacy in a specific context. Our approach concludes that the VI-DAS 720-degree observation technology can respect the user's privacy through an appropriate flow of personal information. However, the flows of personal data must be strongly regulated to ensure that data is seen as a value in terms of a commodity to protect human life and not seen as an asset that needs to be turned into value in terms of capital or the facilitation of asymmetric power-relations.'

The paper is based in part on outputs from the VI-DAS EU Horizon 2020 project.

The question of privacy within future level 3 and 4 vehicles is discussed.

Using Nissenbaum's framework of CI we escaped the shadow of the panopticon.

A holistic determination of how in-vehicle observation can protect privacy while allowing the societal benefits is given..

"Connected and autonomous vehicle injury loss events: Potential risk and actuarial considerations for primary insurers"
---
collection: publications

permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1

excerpt: 'The introduction of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to the road transport ecosystem will change the manner of collisions. CAVs are expected to optimize the safety of road users and the wider environment, while alleviating traffic congestion and maximizing occupant comfort. The net result is a reduction in the frequency of motor vehicle collisions, and a reduction in the number of injuries currently seen as “preventable.” A changing risk ecosystem will introduce new challenges and opportunities for primary insurers. Prior studies have highlighted the economic benefit provided by reductions in the frequency of hazardous events. This economic benefit, however, will be offset by the economic detriment incurred by emerging risks and the increased scrutiny placed on existing risks. We posit four plausible scenarios detailing how an introduction of these technologies could result in a larger relative rate of injury claims currently characterized as tail-risk events. In such a scenario, the culmination of these losses will present as a second “hump” in actuarial loss models. We discuss how CAV risk factors and traffic dynamics may combine to make a second “hump” a plausible reality, and discuss a number of opportunities that may arise for primary insurers from a changing road environment.'
