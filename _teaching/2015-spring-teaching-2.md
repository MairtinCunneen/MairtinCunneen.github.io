Module Description
---
This module aims to support the MSc in Business Analytics by providing a conceptual framework relating to ethics, and governance, that informs data analytics activities and research. Such frameworks are now standardised across international Data science, Business Analytics research programs. For such reasons, the module aims to build upon this rationale and provide a unique component informed by the established data ethics research, and governance research group in the KBS. The use of personal data in contexts of analytics poses serious ethical and legal questions in terms of inputs and outputs. The purpose of the module is to frame data analytics technologies as technologies that need to be developed in parallel to frameworks that are informed by ethics and governance.
